You can download a zip file containing the solution of the final project below:

The ZIP file does NOT contain the Stripe test key, as you should be creating your own. 

Feel free to remix the project. You can use it for your job interview to start your own project. You can add features, remove features, and host the project online. The only restriction is hosting the original project with the instructions that were provided on React Tutorial.

Feel free to refer back to the [Deploying to Netlify](https://react-tutorial.app/app.html?id=1230) lesson if you'd like to deploy it yourself.

That was a big comprehensive project that included the following major React concepts that you've learned about throughout this course:

* JSX
* Props
* State
* Hooks
* Effect
* Components
* Immutability
* Events
* Forms
* Lifting state up
* Passing props down
* Using APIs & fetch
* Custom hooks
* Restoring from localStorage
* React Router
* and many more!

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
